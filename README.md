 ## General Information

The aim of this project is to run an analysis over the Science and Technology project funding awarded by the Chilean State in 2022. I expect to run descriptive and exploratory analysis over the data, which was collected from the [OBSERVA](observa.minciencia.gob.cl) platform of the chilean Ministry of Science. I expect to condense my findings in a dashboard made using Tableau for proper visualization.
